# Spatial Suitability Analysis for Granadilla Crop using R and QGIS 🌍🌱

This project presents a spatial suitability analysis for cultivating *Passiflora ligularis* (granadilla) using R and QGIS. The objective was to identify optimal agricultural zones based on environmental and soil variables through spatial interpolation and weighted overlay techniques.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **R**: raster, terra, tidyverse, ggplot2, sf
- **QGIS**: for initial GIS data processing
- **R Markdown**: for report generation and visualizations

## 📌 Methodology

1. Preprocessing of spatial and environmental data
2. Interpolation using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and/or Ordinary Kriging
3. Classification of each factor based on agronomic thresholds
4. Weighted overlay to compute final suitability map
5. Visualization of classified zones (High, Medium, Low suitability)

## 📊 Results

The analysis identified specific zones with high potential for granadilla cultivation, supporting data-driven decision-making in agricultural planning.
