# Effect of GA₃ and Imbibition Time on Germination of Radish (Raphanus sativus L.)  🌍🌱

This project evaluated the interaction between different concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA₃) and hours of imbibition on the germination of Raphanus sativus (radish) seeds. A 3² factorial design was used with three levels of gibberellic acid (GA) concentration (0, 3, and 6 ppm) and three levels of imbibition (0, 6, and 12 hours), with three replicates per treatment.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **R**: agricolae, readxl
- **R Markdown**: for report generation and visualizations

## 📌 Methodology

1. Preprocessing of spatial and environmental data
2. Interpolation using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and/or Ordinary Kriging
3. Classification of each factor based on agronomic thresholds
4. Weighted overlay to compute final suitability map
5. Visualization of classified zones (High, Medium, Low suitability)

## 📊 Results

The analysis identified specific zones with high potential for granadilla cultivation, supporting data-driven decision-making in agricultural planning.
